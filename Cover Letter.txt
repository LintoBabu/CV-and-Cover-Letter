Subject: Application for Flutter Developer Position

Dear Sir,

I am writing to express my interest in the Flutter Developer position at TenTwenty, With a background in computer applications and a strong foundation in various IT skills, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Applications (BCA) and have completed a software testing certification course. In my previous role as a Flutter Developer at Bluesky Technology Consultants FZE in Ajman, I gained hands-on experience in developing and maintaining mobile applications using Flutter. However, after resigning from that position, I faced challenges in finding new opportunities in Flutter development, which led to a temporary loss of touch with the technology.

Despite this, my experience as a developer has equipped me with a solid understanding of software development principles and practices. I am eager to re-enter the field and am committed to quickly updating my skills to meet the current technologies and requirements.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background and skills align with the needs of your team.

Best regards,
Linto
